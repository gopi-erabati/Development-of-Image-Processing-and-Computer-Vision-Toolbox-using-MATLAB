# Development-of-Image-Processing-and-Computer-Vision-Toolbox-using-MATLAB

Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions. So, to do all this pre-processing using image processing tools and other tools is preferred. So, we aim at building a toolbox where we can do all sort of image processing and computer vision processes in one interface. 
MATLAB is a powerful tool to do what we aim at. So, we explore MATLAB to build our Computer Vision (CV) toolbox. We also make use of the MATLAB's Graphical User Interface (GUI) facility to built a good user interface for our toolbox.
